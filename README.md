🐶🐱 Dog/Cat Sound Identification

📖 About
This web app listens to animal sounds and identifies if it is a dog, cat, or other. It uses a simple sound classification model to process live audio. I have uploaded model from Teachabler Machine

💡 Motivation
I wanted to explore sound recognition in web browsers and build a project that is interactive and educational.
